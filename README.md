# Tyler Schneider

Senior Software Engineer focused on backend systems, data pipelines, and event-driven architecture.
Background in Ruby on Rails monoliths, distributed event ingestion, analytics, and system refactors at scale.

I value correctness, testability, and operational clarity over novelty.

## What I Work On

**Backend & Systems**

* Ruby on Rails (monoliths and service-oriented designs)
* PostgreSQL (OLTP), ClickHouse (OLAP exploration), Kafka (event pipelines)
* Background processing, data ingestion, and analytics pipelines
* Refactoring legacy systems without breaking production behavior

**Engineering Practices**

* Test-first development (Minitest)
* CI/CD and production-safe migrations
* Schema design, data correctness, and failure analysis
* Explicit tradeoffs over “magic” abstractions

---

## Professional Experience (Summary)

* Started as a junior engineer working on feature delivery in a large Rails application
* Transitioned into refactoring and UI stability work while maintaining backward compatibility
* Later worked on an **events and analytics platform**:

  * Designed developer-friendly APIs for consistent event capture
  * Built ingestion and processing pipelines using background workers and Kafka
  * Supported user-facing analytics and reporting features

**Lessons learned (earned, not theoretical):**

* Event systems fail quietly when schemas, volume, and query patterns are not planned early
* Querying raw event tables at extreme scale is not viable without purpose-built storage

---

## Current Focus

* Designing **explicit, testable domain logic** decoupled from frameworks
* Exploring **event-driven systems** with clearer operational boundaries
* Improving system documentation and architectural communication

---

## What You’ll Find Here

* Small, focused repositories
* Architecture experiments with clear scope
* Tradeoff-driven designs (not “perfect” systems)
* Code intended to be read and reasoned about
